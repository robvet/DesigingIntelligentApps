## OCR Capabilties

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a specific technology used to convert different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDF files, or images captured by a digital camera, into editable and searchable data. 

While OCR can be part of a broader computer vision toolkit, it focuses specifically on text extraction.

Azure Cognitive Services provides an OCR API as part of its Computer Vision service. This OCR capability can be used in conjunction with other computer vision tools to enhance the image analysis process.
